# Azure-Data-Engineering-Project-Tokyo-Olympics

The Tokyo Olympic Data Analysis on Azure project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering and analytics solution for exploring Olympic Games data using Azure's cloud services. Starting with a CSV dataset hosted on GitHub, the data is ingested into Azure through Azure Data Factory and stored in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. It is then transformed and enriched using Azure Databricks before undergoing advanced analytics in Azure Synapse. The final insights are visualized using Azure Synapse or Power BI, showcasing a scalable and efficient approach to processing, transforming, and analyzing large volumes of data while leveraging the power of Azure's ecosystem.
